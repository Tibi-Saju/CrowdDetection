# CrowdDetection
A PHP, Python, MySQL project for detecting crowd status at public spaces.

Ample is constructed as a web-based application that can be used by both the users and authorities/public space owners. The application features and functionalities vary depending on the role of the user who is using it. The application is great at public spaces such as halls, shops, government offices etc., where social distancing can be a major concern. The application enables the user to analyse crowds at a place prior to the visit and plan accordingly. The user can perform functions such as updating their profile information, viewing nearby shops, knowing the crowd and area status etc. Similarly, the public space owners may update its information, determine whether it is
in the containment zone and alert the users.
For this CCTV footage of the public outlets registered in the application are collected and using YOLO algorithm and object detection, the number of people in the specified area are detected and if the number exceeds the maximum limit a notification will be sent to the user saying, the area is crowded and canâ€™t visit now. And in this way, the crowds in the public places can be controlled, which becomes extremely important for crowd control and crowd safety. In public gatherings, it is important to know the number of people attending the event which can provide useful pieces of information for future event planning and public space design.
